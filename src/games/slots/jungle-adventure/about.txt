Game Title: Jungle Quest

Theme: Jungle adventure

Gameplay:

Jungle Quest is a 5-reel, 3-row video slot game with 20 paylines.
The game features symbols like jungle animals (tigers, monkeys, parrots, etc.), jungle fruits (bananas, coconuts, etc.), and adventurer gear (binoculars, compass, etc.).
The highest paying symbol is the jungle explorer, which can pay up to 1,000 coins for 5 of a kind.
The wild symbol is a jungle vine, which can substitute for any other symbol except the scatter and bonus symbols.
The scatter symbol is a jungle temple, which can pay up to 100x the total bet and trigger the free spins bonus round.
The bonus symbol is a treasure chest, which can trigger the pick-and-click bonus round.
Bonus Features:

Free Spins: If 3 or more scatter symbols land anywhere on the reels, the free spins bonus round is triggered. Players are awarded 10 free spins, during which all wins are multiplied by 3. Additional free spins can be triggered by landing 3 or more scatter symbols during the free spins round.
Pick-and-Click Bonus: If 3 or more bonus symbols land on an active payline, the pick-and-click bonus round is triggered. Players are presented with a screen showing several treasure chests, and must choose one to reveal a coin prize. The prize can be multiplied by up to 10x if the player picks the correct chest.
Game Rules:

Players can adjust their bet level and coin value before spinning the reels.
Winning combinations are formed by landing 3 or more matching symbols on an active payline, starting from the leftmost reel.
Only the highest win per active payline is paid out.
Wins from the bonus rounds are added to any wins from the base game.
The game has an RTP (return to player) of 96%, meaning that on average, players can expect to get back $96 for every $100 they wager over the long term.
That's an example of how an adventure-themed slot game like Jungle Quest might work. Of course, there are many variations and options that can be included depending on the game developer's preferences and target audience.
